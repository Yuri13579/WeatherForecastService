# WeatherForecastService
Create dockerised .Net Core microservice that has a single API endpoint that serves weather forecast. The input is a date, city, and country. The response should contain collection of forecasts from at least 3 web sites. Data is taken is obtained via api integration or parsing the website's HTML content. The service must cache the values to avoid unnecessary calls. Implement the service using best practices. Deploy the app to free tier Azure service you prefer and provide a postman collection.
